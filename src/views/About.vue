    <p class="body-sarit">
      I served in the IDF for 20 years which allowed me to raise my family as I was home every day around 3pm.  It was an amazing career but after some time I felt there was a need for a change and to start a new chapter of my life.  I retired from the IDF to start a business of my own.
      <br/>
      I managed my own beauty business of 8 employees and after a few years I decided to close my business to try out the workforce as a regular employee again.
      After trying a few opportunities, I found that I excelled as an insurance agent and loved doing for six years.  Again I decided to try go out on my own and try something new.
      <br/>
      One Shabbat dinner at my son in law’s mother asked me, "Why don’t you go to real estate? It really suits you! "
      This is how I found my path ...
      <br/>
      I joined Remax agency in Ramat Gan, and the rest, as they say ... history.
      In the first year of my work as a real estate consultant at the Agency, I received a certificate of appreciation for the amount of sales, and I was awarded the title of "The President Club". Three years later I decided to combine the two loves of my life: the world of sales - and the world of training. I accompanied real estate consultants at every stage of their careers. From those who are debating whether the field suits them to those who want to build a team that will help them in career advancement. During the year 2017, I registered another achievement and published the book, "A winning recipe for real estate consultant". This is the first book in Israel that provides a professional solution for anyone who wants to turn the consultation into a profession.
      <br/>
      Today I accompany businesses in general and real estate in particular, and raise them on the main road. for further details, please call: 054-5222395
